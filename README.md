According to the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/alleghenycountypennsylvania/PST045217), the racial makeup of Allegheny County on July 1, 2017, was estimated as follows:  
* Black or African American alone:	13.4%  
* Asian alone: 4.0%  
* Hispanic or Latino: 2.1%  
* American Indian and Alaska Native alone: 0.2%  
* Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone: less than 0.1%  
* White alone, not Hispanic or Latino: 78.6%  
* Two or More Races: 2.2%  

Some assumptions: 
* Native Hawaiians would likely be counted as Indigenous by the
  Allegheny County Jail census. Asian Pacific Islanders would likely be counted as Asian?
* People of two or more races might be counted as "Unknown"?
* When the Jail says "white," they mean "white - non-Hispanic"

According to the [Allegheny County Jail Daily Census](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-jail-daily-census), on July 1, 2017, the breakdown of prisoners was as follows:
